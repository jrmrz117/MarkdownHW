# Advanced Sytax

Hello again, here you can take a look at the more advanced syntax so that you can continue making your README with even more variety! I will use different syntax for you to see things a bit better.

## Code Block

When writing markdown if you were to create a code tutorial, it would be useful to add some code to it for people to be able to follow along. You can do this by indenting four times before the code you want to write or if in a list you must indent four times or two tabs.

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>CODE</title>
      </head>

## Links

You can create links using whichever website you want or in my opinion more interesting is creating links between your markdown pages. Creating links between your markdown pages can make things a lot easier to categorize what you are sharing. Just like this markdown doc. 
First, the format will need brackets[] for the name of the link you choose and parentheses() for the website url. The way to link markdown pages is to directly link it in the parentheses. Like if you had a another markdown as secondpage.md the secondpage.md would go inside the parentheses. You could then link your README to your second page as a basic back button.

[second page](secondpage.md)

## Image

You can create an image link in markdown almost the same way you create the links above. You just put an exclamation mark infront of the link format and you put your image link in the parentheses and whatever text in the brackets.
