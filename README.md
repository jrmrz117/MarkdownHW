I will be going through the basic and some of the advanced syntax and functions of each symbol and how they interact with the text we will see on the screen. 

Purpose: 
--------
You will be able to make basic markdown pages and this will give you skills to make your own README in your github repositories.

Target Audience
---------------
This is for anyone who is interested in learning about coding markdown files. Really this is for anyone with minor coding knowledge or someone with github who is wondering how to write their README.
