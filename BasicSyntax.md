# Basic Syntax
Hello, this is where you can take a look at the basic sytax of markdown so you can start writing your README!

1. **Heading**  

We can use the hashtag for heading sizes. There are six different sizes going down in numerical order. You must put a space between the hashtags and what words your header will consist of.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

2. **Alternative Heading**

We can use the dash (-) and the equal (=) signs to make something a header. The dash will make it heading 2 size and the equal will make it heading 1 size. You must match the length of your header with the same length of the equal or dashes. EX.----------- or =========

Heading 1
=========

Heading 2
---------

3. **Bold**

We can use the double asterisk ** or double underscores __ as the indicator before and after what we would like to be bold. 

**bold**

__bold 2__

4. **Italic** 

As above we can use the single asterisk * or single underscore _ before and after to italicize the text of your choice.

*italic*

_italic 2_

5. **Bold and Italic**

We can use the triple asterisk *** or triple ___ underscores to bold and italicize your choice in text.

***Bold***

___Italics___
